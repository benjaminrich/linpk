Title: Generate Concentration-Time Profiles From Linear PK Systems
Authors@R: person("Benjamin", "Rich", role=c("aut", "cre"), email="mail@benjaminrich.net")
Description: Generate concentration-time profiles from linear pharmacokinetic
  (PK) systems, possibly with first-order absorption or zero-order infusion,
  possibly with one or more peripheral compartments, and possibly under
  steady-state conditions. Single or multiple doses may be specified. Secondary
  (derived) PK parameters (e.g. Cmax, Ctrough, AUC, Tmax, half-life, etc.) are
  computed.
